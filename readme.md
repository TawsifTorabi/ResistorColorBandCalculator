## Resistor Color Bands Calculator
This is a simple Java JSwing Application to calculate a resistor value from it's color codes.

It features 4 bands, 5 bands and 6 band color inputs.

It can calculate the optimum value for a resistor and it can show the highest and the lowest value for a resistor in different temperature condition.
